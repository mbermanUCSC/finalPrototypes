# SceneFlowPrototype  
Play demo [here](https://mbermanucsc.github.io/finalPrototypes/sceneFlow/)      
A demonstration of different scenes from 'The Report' including  
gameplay, loading scene, title scene, introduction, settings (mobile or computer), credits, and different endings.  
  
Scene types:
- Scene 1: loading screne to load assets for future scenes  
- Scene 2: title screen to start game  
- Scene 3: introduction scene to help introduce player to story  
- Scene 4: settings screen to let the player choose between computer and mobile versions  
- Scene 5: gameplay scenes allow player to move between rooms, pick up items, choose an ending
- Scene 6: 3 different endings for the player to choose from at the end of the gameplay scenes
- Scene 7: credits scene

Communication Between Scenes:  
- Inventory system that tracks inventory between scenes on bottom right, and influences ending options.  

Reachability:  
- Gameplay is shortened to allow the player to choose between the three endings the game has to offer (if they pick up all three items).  
  
Transitions:  
- Each gameplay scene transitions by fading in/out smoothly. Gameplay scenes transition faster to allow switching between rooms quickly.
