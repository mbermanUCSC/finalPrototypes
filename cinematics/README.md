A demonstration of a cinematic experience from 'The Report' including
the menu with interactive and non interactive components, and a non interactive scene with a beginning middle and an end.

**Non-Interactive cinematic:**  
    The piece we chose for the non-interactive cinematic was our introduction to the characters in the story as it really examplifies what our game is about in a clear and concise manor.
    Beginning: the beginning of our cinematic is the fade in for the whole scene.
    Middle: the middle of our cinematic is the underlining of the important pieces in the writing, as well as the sound effect being played.
    Ending: the end of our cinematic is the fade out from the scene.

**Interactive cinematic:**  
    visually alive:
        Not touching: the cinematic is visually alive when not being touched by sliding the items into view. And then having the title on the top swing back and forth almost like a lamp hanging from the roof.
        touching: the cinematic is alive when interacted with as the play button will tween when moused over and is interactable in order to go to the next screen.


**Choreography in code:**  
In order to talk about the choreography it is best to talk about our non-interactive cinematic. The cinematic will fade in, then a tween chain will start where it will underline three separate locations in the page. We will chain from the top to bottom in tweens in order to give the effect of underlining the important components of the dialogue. The way that this chain was done was by having the other tweens not get run until the one before it has finished and once it has completed it will run the next tween. Finally the tween in order to fade out into the next scene will play.
